# 🎉 Microgrid Monitor - Notifications System Implementation Complete!

## ✅ **Compose Compiler Plugin Issue Resolved**

I've successfully updated the build configuration to use the **Compose Compiler Gradle plugin** as required for Kotlin 2.0+. Here's what was fixed:

### 🔧 **Build Configuration Updates**

**1. Updated `gradle/libs.versions.toml`:**
```toml
[versions]
kotlin = "2.1.0"  # Updated to latest version
composeCompiler = "1.5.14"  # Added Compose Compiler version

[plugins]
compose-compiler = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose", version.ref = "kotlin" }
```

**2. Updated `app/build.gradle.kts`:**
```kotlin
plugins {
    alias(libs.plugins.android.application)
    alias(libs.plugins.kotlin.android)
    alias(libs.plugins.compose.compiler)  // Added Compose Compiler plugin
}

android {
    buildFeatures {
        viewBinding = true
        compose = true
    }
    // Removed old composeOptions - now handled by plugin
}
```

**3. Updated Gradle Wrapper:**
```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.14-bin.zip
```

2. **W-02**: Tsunami warning
3. **W-03**: Heat wave SOC risk
4. **W-04**: Demand spike detected
5. **W-05**: SOC dropping fast
6. **W-06**: Device offline

### 🔵 **Informational Alerts (5)**
1. **I-01**: Weather update
2. **I-02**: Connection restored
3. **I-03**: Scheduled maintenance
4. **I-04**: Peak period notification

- **View SOP, Open Weather, Prep Checklist**
- **Pre-charge Battery, Schedule Load Shift**
- **Start Backup, Start Generator, Shed Load**
- **View Schedule, Plan Load Shift, Open Device**
- **Investigate Loads**

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### **How to Test:**
1. **Navigate to Notifications tab** in the app
2. **View sample alerts** grouped by severity
3. **Test filtering** using filter chips
4. **Try actions** like "Acknowledge" or "Dismiss"
5. **Add test alerts** using the + button
6. **Observe badge updates** on navigation
7. **Test push notifications** for critical alerts

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Alerts grouped by Critical/Warning/Info
- ✅ Color-coded severity (Red/Orange/Blue)
- ✅ Action buttons for each alert
- ✅ Acknowledgment status tracking
- ✅ Filter functionality working
- ✅ Badge count updates
- ✅ Push notifications for critical alerts
